## 🚀 Project Story  

Banks sit on mountains of data – from customer loans and deposits to income bands and nationalities. But **raw numbers alone don’t help decision-makers**.  

The goal of this project was to build a **comprehensive banking analytics dashboard** that answers key questions:  

- Which customer segments hold the most loans and deposits?  
- Who contributes the most to high-risk exposure?  
- Are banks relying too heavily on specific income groups or nationalities?  
- How do advisors and banking relationships impact performance?  

This dashboard provides **clarity in complexity** by combining interactive filters, drill-downs, and KPIs into one visual story.
